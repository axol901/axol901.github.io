					My interest in programming was born from an interest in video games. I&#39;ve been interested in video games since I was old enough to understand them, and when given the opportunity to learn to make them, I eagerly took it. The earliest of these opportunities took the form of summer camps, though I struggle to recall many details about the first ones I attended, aside from the fact that I learned to use the Games Factory 2 engine. However, my interest and experiences increased dramatically when I first attended the camp held by Game Camp Nation &#40;though it was called Game Camp USA at the time&#41;, which focused both on making and playing games. For the next 10 years, I would attend that summer camp every year it was hosted, learning Construct, Java, Unity- and by extension, C&#35;, Unreal Engine, and more. Though it may have been mostly through tutorials, I got much of my initial understanding of programming from my time there. Once I entered high school, I eventually began taking AP Computer Science classes. It was in these classes that I started to learn how to code properly, and I learned very quickly, earning me a 5 on the Computer Science Principles Exam.

					My experiences in making more advanced projects began once I graduated from high school. After having attended Game Camp for so long, I chose to try to become a counselor myself, and started taking the leadership course they offered, and eventually went on to do an internship for the time they were in Georgia. Over the course of those three weeks, I worked on the game that the camp was making with some occasional help from the campers, and made exceptional progress on programming something that hadn&#39;t even been started when I arrived. Though perhaps not a conventional professional setting, it gave me a better feel for working with others on a game outside of an academic setting. In my college courses, I began work on more complete programs compared to the work I did in high school. When I got the chance to apply the skills I had developed with the Unity game engine to a functioning prototype for my Intro to Software Engineering course in Spring of 2021, I eagerly accepted, and made the entire prototype for my four-person group on my own. Despite my methods still needing a bit more refinement, I earned an A for the group. Once I took on a minor in Computer Game Development and Design and started taking proper game development courses to avoid burning myself out from my major-required courses, I began to refine the skills I had learned in their original environment, and made several games that received high praise from my professors along with high grades, including the game I made for the final project of CGDD 2012L, displayed on the home page.

					My goals are fairly vague, since I prefer to keep them within the bounds of what I can do in the present. One of my most concrete goals is to work for Game Camp full-time, as the administrators are planning to make the development of their game a full-time job alongside the summer camp itself. Aside from that, my goals mostly pertain to the type of work I want to do and the environment I want to do it in. The kinds of games I want to make are those that are first and foremost meant to be enjoyable experiences, both in gameplay and narrative, not just products to provide me with income. In accordance with that, I want to work for a smaller studio rather than a larger one, in order to avoid the practices and mindsets that are employed by them. I believe that a game should always be able to make the world a better place, even if it&#39;s just by bringing a bit more joy to the people that play them, just as the many games I&#39;ve played over my life have done for me.
