					Welcome to the portfolio website of an aspiring game developer. My name is Connor Stabler, and I am a Software Engineering major in my senior year at KSU. I am taking this course because I believed that it would benefit me to learn as many of the most commonly used programming languages as I could, and I had yet to learn HTML. The works shown on this page are what I deem to be among the best to represent my time at KSU and the skills I&#39;ve learned along the way. Please view the text accompanying each image for more details regarding those works.
