					Welcome to the portfolio website of an aspiring game developer. My name is Connor Stabler, and I am a Software Engineering major in my senior year at KSU. I am taking this course because I believed that it would benefit me to learn as many of the most commonly used programming languages as I could, and I had yet to learn HTML. The works shown on this page are what I deem to be among the best to represent my time at KSU and the skills I&#39;ve learned along the way. Please view the text accompanying each image for more details regarding those works.

					This screenshot is of a functional prototype I created for SWE 3313 &#40;Introduction to Software Engineering&#41; in Spring of 2021. It was for a restaurant table management system that would be used by employees, such as waiters and management, to track the state of tables, the food they ordered and which seat ordered it, and to send alerts to the kitchen when new items were ordered. Despite it being part of a group project, I ended up completing it alone. It was my first major programming project that had proper functional and non-functional requirements rather than a rubric, and I believe it was far from perfect on the back end. Though the final version received an A, my methods were largely unrefined, and showed that I had significant room for improvement. Despite this, I believe that it shows an important part of my time at KSU.

					This screenshot is of a game I created for the final project in CGDD 2012L &#40;Fundamentals of Game Design Lab&#41; in Spring of 2023. There were a variety of elements this game had to include, including various enemies with different behaviors, different weapons for the player to use, randomized enemy and item spawns with their coordinates saved to local files, and dynamic difficulty adjustment. Thankfully, I was allowed to use the previous project for the course as a starting point for this one, but it was still a highly difficult task. Despite having to fundamentally change the inner workings of several parts of the game in order to meet the requirements, I still managed to pull through and get not only a high grade, but high praise from my professor, who said that it would take only a bit more work for it to be a release-quality mobile game. Even now, I think it is some of the best work I&#39;ve done at KSU.

					These screenshots are of a prototype I created for SWE 4324 &#40;User Centered Design&#41; in Fall of 2023. The prototype was not actually programmed, but was a collection of images with areas that would send the viewer to other images if clicked on. The tool used for this prototype was intended for use in prototyping websites, but in this case was used to design an app. The specifics of the app were different from person to person, as we each had a partner with a specific functionality, and we were meant to design an interface that would control a robot with that functionality. My partner&#39;s functionality- and thus the one I was designing for- was a mechanic robot. This involved research such as gathering requirements from my partner and further details about the task to be performed, a good understanding of UI design to make it intuitive, and a considerable amount of patience, as I had to make each state of certain screens individually, since there was no back-end of the prototype for storing or retrieving data. This resulted in 87 different screens- though a full prototype would have taken more than 500 million to account for every possible state. Though it wasn&#39;t programming work, this prototype helped me refine my design skills and ability to take requirements and turn them into a more usable form for development. This was particularly helpful for this course, since designing this site would likely have been more difficult without the prior experience.
